## generators-and-async (completed branch)
> This is the completed branch, for the incomplete version go [here](//github.com/jon-hall/generators-and-async/tree/master).

An introduction to how generators can be leveraged to flatten asynchronous code into a more manageable structure.

It comprises two basic exercises, the first of which illustrates how Promise-based code can be de-cluttered using generators to 'await' on promises.  In the other example, we build our own miniature version of the library used in the first project (`co`) to understand how it actually works under the hood.

#### Prerequisites
In order to run the projects in this repo you'll need to have a version of node (preferably `>=4.0.0`) installed (you can check your version by entering `node -v` in a command prompt).  You can get the installer from [here](//nodejs.org) if you don't have node yet, or want to update.

You'll also need git (or a git client) to clone this repo.

#### Projects
Each folder contains a mini-project with it's own README which explains some of the concepts being illustrated, and how to complete each exercise, if you want to try it for yourself.

Project walkthroughs:
